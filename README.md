## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following software and packages installed:

- R programming language (version 4.3.2): [Download R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- RStudio (optional, but recommended): [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

In addition, you will need to install the following R packages:

- `GEOquery`: This package is used for downloading GEO data. It provides functions to access and retrieve data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.
- `limma`: This package is used for differential gene expression analysis. It provides functions for fitting linear models to microarray and RNA-seq data and performing statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes.
- `WebGestaltR`: This package is used for gene enrichment analysis. It provides functions to perform functional enrichment analysis using the WebGestalt web server.
- `biomaRt`: This package is used for accessing biological data from online databases. It provides functions to retrieve gene annotations, sequences, and other genomic information from the BioMart databases.
- `openxlsx`: This package is used for reading and writing Excel files. It provides functions to read data from Excel files into R and write data frames to Excel files.
- `readxl`: This package is used for reading Excel files. It provides functions to read data from Excel files into R.
- `writexl`: This package is used for writing Excel files. It provides functions to write data frames to Excel files.

To use the provided R code, make sure to install the required packages using the following commands:

```R
install.packages("GEOquery")
install.packages("limma")
install.packages("WebGestaltR")
install.packages("biomaRt")
install.packages("openxlsx")
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("writexl")
```

After installing the packages, you can load them in your R script using the `library()` function:

```R
library(GEOquery)
library(limma)
library(WebGestaltR)
library(biomaRt)
library(openxlsx)
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
```
Please ensure that you have an internet connection to download the required packages and access online resources.

For more information on each package and its documentation, please refer to the respective package documentation and vignettes.

- `openxlsx`: [Documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/package=openxlsx)
- `readxl`: [Documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/package=readxl)
- `writexl`: [Documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/package=writexl)

Please refer to the documentation for each package to learn more about their functionalities and usage.

## Installation

To use this code, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/geo-data-analysis.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the code as a ZIP file by clicking on the "Code" button on this GitHub repository page and selecting "Download ZIP".

## Usage

1. Open the RStudio IDE or any other R environment.

2. Set the working directory to the location where you cloned or downloaded this repository.

3. Open the `analysis.R` file and modify the code according to your specific analysis requirements. This file contains the code for downloading GEO data, preprocessing the data, performing differential gene expression analysis using `limma`, and generating plots using `ggplot2`.

4. Run the code in the `analysis.R` file step by step or all at once.

5. The results of the analysis will be saved in the specified output directory and can be further explored or visualized.
