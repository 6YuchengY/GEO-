## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following software and packages installed:

- R programming language (version 4.3.2): [Download R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- RStudio (optional, but recommended): [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

In addition, you will need to install the following R packages:

- `GEOquery`: Used for downloading GEO data.
- `limma`: Used for differential gene expression analysis.
- `ggplot2`: Used for data visualization.

You can install these packages by running the following command in R:

```R
install.packages(c("GEOquery", "limma", "ggplot2"))
```

## Installation

To use this code, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/geo-data-analysis.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the code as a ZIP file by clicking on the "Code" button on this GitHub repository page and selecting "Download ZIP".

## Usage

1. Open the RStudio IDE or any other R environment.

2. Set the working directory to the location where you cloned or downloaded this repository.

3. Open the `analysis.R` file and modify the code according to your specific analysis requirements. This file contains the code for downloading GEO data, preprocessing the data, performing differential gene expression analysis using `limma`, and generating plots using `ggplot2`.

4. Run the code in the `analysis.R` file step by step or all at once.

5. The results of the analysis will be saved in the specified output directory and can be further explored or visualized.
